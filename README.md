# Apple Stock Price Prediction - Deep Learning

This project involves developing a deep learning model to predict Apple's closing stock price one week in advance. The model is developed in Python, using the PyTorch library for constructing and training the model.

Date of Project Completion: April 2023

## Features

Decomposition of Time Series Data into trend, seasonality, and residual components using the additive model.
Preprocessing of time series data through normalization and segmentation into sequences with a ten-day look-back period.
Implementation of a two-layer Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer and a fully connected layer for regression.
Mean Squared Error (MSE) used as a loss function to train the model.
